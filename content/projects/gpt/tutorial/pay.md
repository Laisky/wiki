## Introduction 🎉

*[(👉 中文版)](@page_gpt_pay_cn)*

Unlock all the cool features in two simple ways:

1. Use your own OpenAI API key. 🔑
2. Or buy a special API key from me. 🎁

Please contact me by email: `chat@laisky.com`.

## How to Buy 🛍️

First, create an account [here](https://oneapi.laisky.com/register). Then, tell me your account name. You can add funds to your account using WeChat, Alipay, or PayPal. 🏦 Since we don't have a direct payment method yet, we'll chat over email to arrange the transfer. 📧

Don't worry, this is a non-profit project. I don't charge extra fees or make any profit. The exchange rate is based on the current US dollar market price plus a small fee for the transfer. 💸

Try not to add more than 100 RMB at a time. 💰

## Refunds

If you need a refund, just email me. We'll calculate the refund based on the market price when you added the funds. 📈

## How to Use 🚀

### Web Usage

The easiest way is to go to [https://chat.laisky.com/](https://chat.laisky.com/), and put your API key in the top right corner.

After you enter your API key, just refresh the page, and voila! All features are unlocked. 🎊
