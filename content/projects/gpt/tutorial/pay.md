## Introduction ðŸŽ‰

_[(ðŸ‘‰ ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆ)](@page_gpt_pay_cn)_

Free users can only access a limited set of models and features. By adding credit on the Oneâ€‘API platform, you become a paid user and unlock all supported models and features. See the sections below for purchase methods and the list of supported models.

If you have any questions, email me at `chat@laisky.com`.

Updates are posted on the Telegram channel: <https://t.me/laisky_oai>

The project source code is available on GitHub. If you encounter issues, you can open an Issue or submit a PR directly: <https://github.com/laisky/one-api>

## Topâ€‘up Methods

### Statement

Because some thirdâ€‘party channels provide lowâ€‘quality models, I have decided to stop using any thirdâ€‘party providers. Only official channels from OpenAI, Azure, Groq, Anthropic, Google, AWS, Cloudflare, DeepSeek, and Replicate are supported.

**All content on this site comes exclusively from the official APIs listed above. No other thirdâ€‘party channels are used.**

### Register an Account

First, create an account at <https://oneapi.laisky.com/register>.

### Purchase a Topâ€‘up Code

Transfer funds via Alipay, WeChat, OKX, Binance, or Bybit, then email me (`chat@laisky.com`) with the transfer amount and transaction details. I will process the request quickly and send you a topâ€‘up code.

Wechat/Alipay RMB transfers are converted to USD using the fixed exchange rate 8:1. Crypto payments accept major stablecoins such as USDT, USDC, FDUSD, DAI, and are exchanged 1:1 with USD.

## Refund Policy

Email me for a refund; the amount will be returned at the market price at the time of the original topâ€‘up.

## Thirdâ€‘Party Integration

All requests must go through my gateway; direct calls to OpenAI are not allowed. When using a thirdâ€‘party app, set both `API_BASE` and `API_KEY` in the app:

- `API_BASE` â†’ `https://oneapi.laisky.com` or `https://oneapi.laisky.com/v1`
- `API_KEY` â†’ your token

Be aware that the URL path for `API_BASE` varies by product. Some require `/v1`, others need the full path `/v1/chat/completions`. Consult the documentation of the tool you are using to determine the correct format.

Examples for thirdâ€‘party products:

### Claude Code

```sh
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="openai/gpt-oss-120b"
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://oneapi.laisky.com/"
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="sk-xxxxxxx"
```

### Codex Cli

```sh
# vi $HOME/.codex/config.toml

model = "gemini-2.5-flash"
model_provider = "laisky"

[model_providers.laisky]
# Name of the provider that will be displayed in the Codex UI.
name = "Laisky"
# The path `/chat/completions` will be amended to this URL to make the POST
# request for the chat completions.
base_url = "https://oneapi.laisky.com/v1"
# If `env_key` is set, identifies an environment variable that must be set when
# using Codex with this provider. The value of the environment variable must be
# non-empty and will be used in the `Bearer TOKEN` HTTP header for the POST request.
env_key = "sk-xxxxxxx"
# Valid values for wire_api are "chat" and "responses". Defaults to "chat" if omitted.
wire_api = "responses"
# If necessary, extra query params that need to be added to the URL.
# See the Azure example below.
query_params = {}
```

## Permanent Storage on Arweave

With your API key you can also use the Arweave fileâ€‘upload API to store files permanently on Arweave via GraphQL, Telegram Bot, etc. See the blog for more details: <https://blog.laisky.com/p/arweave>.

### Telegram Bot

Add the bot on Telegram: [@laisky_alert_bot](https://t.me/laisky_alert_bot). After linking your account as shown below, you can send files directly to be stored on Arweave.

![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2025/01/arweave-bot.jpeg)

### GraphQL API

- Endpoint: `https://gq.laisky.com/query/`
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}`

Convert the file to a base64 string and call the `ArweaveUpload` mutation with the `fileB64` argument.

```js
// request
mutation ar {
  ArweaveUpload(
    fileB64: "aGVsbG8="
  ) {
    file_id
  }
}

// response
{
    "data": {
        "ArweaveUpload": {
            "file_id": "TprLA3XlyRHlxb9jIG0TCV6v4rimGkMDReKyVMp_iMY"
        }
    }
}
```

Example with `curl`:

```sh
curl --location 'https://gq.laisky.com/query/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer sk-xxxxxxx' \
--data '{"query":"mutation ar {\r\n  ArweaveUpload(\r\n    fileB64: \"aGVsbG8=\"\r\n  ) {\r\n    file_id\r\n  }\r\n}","variables":{}}'
```
